# Enhancing_RedWine_Quality
This project focused on predicting the potability of water using a machine learning model. Key variables such as pH, hardness, TDS, and other water quality indicators were analyzed. The process involved thorough data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy.
Evaluated and implemented using different machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression
and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
